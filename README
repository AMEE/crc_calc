AMEE CRC Calculator
===================

This is an example Rails application that uses AMEE to calculates emissions and
construct a report based on the UK Government's Consultation on the Draft Order
to Implement the Carbon Reduction Commitment (see
http://explorer.amee.com/categories/Carbon_Reduction_Commitment for more details).

You can create your own copy of this application at http://my.amee.com/templates/11-crc,
or you can use this codebase to run your own copy on your own servers. You may also
use it as a base from which to develop your own AMEE applications.
